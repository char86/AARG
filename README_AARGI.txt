Running AARGI:

1) Ensure that MATLAB (v.2014 or later) is installed. 

2) Copy the AARGI folder to a convenient location and add it to the Matlab path.
 
3) Type 'AARGI' into the Matlab command line to bring up the AARGI user interface.

4) Click the help button or watch the AARGI video tutorial for further assistance.

A paper introducing AARG analysis will be published either in a peer-reviewed journal or on bioRxiv.org. Video tutorials and a discussion forum will also be available.
